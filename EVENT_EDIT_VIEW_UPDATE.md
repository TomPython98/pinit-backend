# ✨ EventEditView Google Places Integration

## Summary
Updated **EventEditView** to use the same beautiful Google Places integration as EventCreationView, providing a consistent, polished location search experience across the app.

## Changes Made

### **1. Replaced Old Search Systems**
**Removed:**
- ❌ Apple Maps (MKLocalSearch) - 60+ lines
- ❌ Mapbox Geocoding - 70+ lines  
- ❌ Fallback geocoder - 20+ lines
- ❌ Old suggestion system - String-based

**Added:**
- ✅ Google Places Service (singleton)
- ✅ Enhanced location suggestions (with photos & ratings)
- ✅ Thread-safe async/await pattern
- ✅ Proper task management

### **2. Updated State Variables**
```swift
// Before ❌
@State private var locationSuggestions: [String] = []

// After ✅
@State private var locationSuggestions: [GooglePlacesService.LocationSuggestion] = []
@State private var selectedLocation: GooglePlacesService.LocationSuggestion?
@State private var isSearchingSuggestions = false

private let googlePlacesService = GooglePlacesService.shared
```

### **3. Enhanced UI Components**
```swift
// Beautiful suggestion cards with photos
EnhancedLocationSuggestionCard(
    suggestion: suggestion,
    onTap: {
        searchTask?.cancel()
        selectLocation(suggestion)
    }
)

// Detailed location card when selected
SelectedLocationDetailCard(
    suggestion: selected,
    onDeselect: {
        withAnimation {
            isLocationSelected = false
            selectedLocation = nil
        }
    }
)
```

### **4. Simplified Search Functions**
```swift
// Clean, safe Google Places search
private func searchLocationSuggestions(query: String) {
    guard !query.isEmpty, query.count >= 2, query.count <= 100 else {
        locationSuggestions = []
        showLocationSuggestions = false
        return
    }
    
    isSearchingSuggestions = true
    
    Task {
        do {
            let results = try await googlePlacesService.searchLocations(
                query: query, 
                near: selectedCoordinate
            )
            
            guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }
            
            await MainActor.run {
                self.locationSuggestions = results
                self.showLocationSuggestions = !results.isEmpty
            }
        } catch {
            // Graceful error handling
        }
    }
}
```

### **5. Improved Selection Flow**
```swift
private func selectLocation(_ suggestion: GooglePlacesService.LocationSuggestion) {
    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3)) {
        suppressLocationOnChange = true
        locationName = suggestion.name
        selectedCoordinate = suggestion.coordinate
        selectedLocation = suggestion
        
        // Clean state management
        isLocationSelected = true
        showLocationSuggestions = false
        locationSuggestions = []
        isSearchingSuggestions = false
    }
}
```
