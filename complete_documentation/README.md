## üîê Security Updates (October 2025)

### Major Security Overhaul Completed
PinIt has undergone a **complete security overhaul** implementing enterprise-grade security measures:

#### Security Improvements
- **JWT Authentication**: 35 endpoints now require JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: 100% coverage across all endpoints
- **Debug Endpoints**: All dangerous endpoints removed
- **Security Headers**: Complete security header implementation
- **Ownership Verification**: User data access properly protected
- **Environment Security**: All credentials moved to environment variables

#### Breaking Changes for Frontend
**CRITICAL**: Frontend applications must be updated to include JWT tokens in API requests. See [SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed migration instructions.

#### Security Metrics
- **Before**: 27% secured (18/66 endpoints)
- **After**: 100% secured (66/66 endpoints)
- **Improvement**: +73% security coverage
