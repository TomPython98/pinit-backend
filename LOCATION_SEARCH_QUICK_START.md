# üöÄ Enhanced Location Search - Quick Start

## What's New?
Your location search now finds **bars, restaurants, cafes, and local businesses by name** - not just addresses!

Search for "Buda Bar" in Buenos Aires and it will now actually find it! üéâ

## How Does It Work?
- **Mapbox** + **Foursquare** working together
- Searches both APIs simultaneously
- Up to 10 results instead of 5
- Shows business categories: "Buda Bar (Nightclub)"
- Instant coordinate selection (no re-geocoding)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required: Get Foursquare API Key

The enhanced search works, but you need a **free** Foursquare API key to unlock finding local businesses.

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Sign up**: https://foursquare.com/developers/
2. **Create project**: Choose "Places API"
3. **Copy your API key**: Starts with `fsq3...`
4. **Add to app**: 
   - Open `EventCreationView.swift`
   - Find line ~955: `let apiKey = "fsq3..."`
   - Replace with your key

**Free Tier**: 100,000 calls/day - way more than you'll ever need!

## Test It Out

Try searching for these in Buenos Aires:
- ‚úÖ "Buda Bar"
- ‚úÖ "Caf√© Tortoni"
- ‚úÖ "Don Julio"
- ‚úÖ "starbucks" (finds nearby ones)

## Without Foursquare Key?

The app still works! It just uses Mapbox only (like before), which is still pretty good for:
- ‚úÖ Addresses
- ‚úÖ Major landmarks
- ‚ùå Local bars/restaurants (limited coverage)

## Files Changed
- `EventCreationView.swift` - Added dual search + Foursquare integration
- `ENHANCED_LOCATION_SEARCH_SETUP.md` - Detailed documentation
- `LOCATION_SEARCH_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Technical overview

## Next Steps

1. Get Foursquare API key (free)
2. Test searching for local businesses
3. Optionally: Apply same improvements to `EventEditView.swift` and `MapBox.swift`
