# üîß Rate Limit Fix for Production

## Problem
Your production app was hitting rate limits and returning **403 Forbidden** errors. The logs showed:

```
django_ratelimit.exceptions.Ratelimited
/api/get_study_events/Besi/ - 403
/api/get_friends/Besi/ - 403
/api/user_images/Besi/ - 403
```

## Root Cause
Rate limits were set too low for a mobile app:
- **100 requests/hour** = Only **1.67 requests/minute**
- Mobile apps refresh data frequently
- One user session could easily exceed this

## Solution Applied

### Rate Limits Increased

| Endpoint | Old Limit | New Limit | Reason |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `get_study_events` | 100/h | **1000/h** | Most frequently accessed - map refreshes |
| `get_friends` | 100/h | **500/h** | Checked on profile loads |
| `get_user_images` | 100/h | **500/h** | Images load on profiles, events |
| `get_profile_completion` | 100/h | **500/h** | Profile data accessed often |
| `search_events` | 100/h | **500/h** | Used for event discovery |
| `enhanced_search_events` | 50/h | **500/h** | Semantic search for events |

### Why These Limits?

**1000/h for get_study_events:**
- Most critical endpoint
- Accessed every time map loads/refreshes
- ~16 requests/minute = Normal usage pattern

**500/h for other GET endpoints:**
- ~8 requests/minute
- Reasonable for profile views, friend lists
- Still protects against abuse

### Security Notes

‚úÖ Still protected against:
- Brute force attacks (login: 5/h)
- Account creation abuse (register: 3/h)
- POST spam (various limits remain)

‚úÖ Only relaxed:
- Authenticated GET requests
- User viewing their own data
- Normal app usage patterns

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Try refreshing the app multiple times
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

**Option A: Git Push (Recommended)**
```bash
git add myapp/views.py
git commit -m "Fix rate limits for production - increase GET endpoint limits"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically detect the push and redeploy.

**Option B: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway up
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. Check Railway logs: https://railway.app/project/your-project/deployments
2. Look for successful deployment message
3. Open your app and test:
   - Open map (should load events without 403)
   - View profile (should load images)
   - Check friends list
   - Refresh multiple times

### 4. Monitor Logs

Watch for these success indicators:
```
200 OK responses instead of 403 Forbidden
No more "django_ratelimit.exceptions.Ratelimited" errors
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken):
```
User opens app
‚Üí Loads map (1st request)
‚Üí 403 Forbidden after 100th request in hour
‚Üí User sees errors, can't load data
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User opens app
‚Üí Loads map freely
‚Üí Refreshes as needed
‚Üí 1000 requests/hour = ~16/minute
‚Üí Normal usage works perfectly
```

## Impact Analysis

### Per User Usage Estimate
```
Typical hourly usage:
- Open app: 5 times
- Each open loads:
  - Events: 1 request
  - Profile: 1 request
  - Friends: 1 request
  - Images: 2-3 requests
  - Reputation: 1 request
= ~35-40 requests per hour for normal use

New limits allow: 500-1000 requests/hour
Safety margin: 12-25x normal usage
```

### Heavy User Scenario
```
Power user refreshing frequently:
- 20 app opens/hour
- 7 requests per open
= 140 requests/hour

Still well within 500-1000 limit ‚úÖ
```

### Abuse Protection
```
Malicious actor trying to spam:
- 500 requests = ~8 per minute
- Still rate-limited after threshold
- Legitimate users unaffected ‚úÖ
```

## Monitoring

### What to Watch

**Good Signs:**
- ‚úÖ 200 OK responses
- ‚úÖ No rate limit errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Users can refresh without issues

**Warning Signs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Individual users hitting 500+/hour consistently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious request patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different error types appearing

### Railway Dashboard
Monitor at: `https://railway.app/project/YOUR_PROJECT/metrics`

Check:
- **Request count** - Should be steady, not spiking
- **Error rate** - Should drop to near 0%
- **Response times** - Should stay under 500ms

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you see abuse or issues:

```bash
# Revert the changes
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Or manually reduce limits back to 100/h in `myapp/views.py`.

## Future Improvements

### Consider Implementing:
1. **Per-endpoint monitoring** - Track which endpoints get most traffic
2. **User-based alerts** - Notify if someone hits limits repeatedly  
3. **Graceful degradation** - Return cached data instead of 403
4. **Rate limit headers** - Tell clients their limit status
5. **Premium tiers** - Higher limits for paid users (if applicable)

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `myapp/views.py` - Updated rate limit decorators

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Can load map multiple times without 403
- [ ] Profile images load consistently
- [ ] Friends list loads without errors
- [ ] Can search events repeatedly
- [ ] Refreshing app works smoothly
- [ ] Railway logs show 200 responses
- [ ] No rate limit tracebacks in logs

## Summary

**Problem**: 100/h rate limits too restrictive  
**Solution**: Increased to 500-1000/h for GET endpoints  
**Impact**: Normal users won't hit limits  
**Security**: Still protected against abuse  
**Action**: Deploy and monitor
