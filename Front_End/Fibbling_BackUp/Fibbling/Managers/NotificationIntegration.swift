 ## Push Notification Integration Guide
 
 There are several components needed to fully integrate push notifications:
 
 ### 1. Fix Module Import Issues
 
 The current codebase has issues with importing UIKit and accessing the StudyEvent model.
 To resolve these, you need to make changes to your project's structure:
 
 #### UIKit Access
 Since this appears to be a macOS or multi-platform app, you need to conditionally use UIKit:
 
 ```swift
 #if canImport(UIKit)
 import UIKit
 #endif
 
 // And when using UIKit classes:
 #if os(iOS)
 // UIKit code here
 #endif
 ```
 
 #### StudyEvent Access
 The StudyEvent model should be accessible without special imports if it's in your project's main target.
 If it's in a separate module, you need to add that module to your project dependencies.
 
 ### 2. Adding AppDelegate to StudyConApp.swift
 
 In your main app file (StudyConApp.swift), you need to add:
 
 ```swift
 import SwiftUI
 #if canImport(UIKit)
 import UIKit
 #endif
 
 @main
 struct StudyConApp: App {
     // Add this line to register the AppDelegate
     @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor private var appDelegate: FibblingAppDelegate
     
     // Rest of your code...
 }
 ```
 */
