# iOS Runtime Issues - Analysis & Fixes

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED  
**Analysis:** Based on production logs

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. **WebSocket Connection Instability** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED
**Symptoms:**
```
❌ WebSocket ping failed: Software caused connection abort
❌ WebSocket receive failed: Connection reset by peer
🔍 🔌 Connection error, reconnecting in 5s: Attempt 1
```

**Root Cause:** 
- WebSocket server dropping connections
- No jitter in reconnection timing (thundering herd)
- Ping failures triggering unnecessary reconnects

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added jitter to reconnection timing (prevents thundering herd)
- ✅ Reduced ping frequency (20s instead of 30s)
- ✅ Smarter ping failure handling (only reconnect on actual connection loss)
- ✅ Better error classification

---

### 2. **Image Loading Timeouts** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED
**Symptoms:**
```
Task finished with error [-1001] "The request timed out."
⏳ Retrying image load (attempt 1/3) in 2.0s...
```

**Root Cause:**
- Network timeouts on image downloads
- No retry logic for failed images
- Fixed timeout values

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Created `ImageRetryManager` with exponential backoff
- ✅ Increased timeout to 15 seconds
- ✅ Smart retry logic (only retry on network errors)
- ✅ Better error classification

---

### 3. **Friend Requests Parsing Error** ⚠️ → ✅ FIXED
**Symptoms:**
```
Error parsing friend requests: The data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Backend returning inconsistent JSON format
- No fallback parsing logic

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added raw response logging for debugging
- ✅ Fallback parsing (try array format if object fails)
- ✅ Better error handling with specific error messages

---

### 4. **Mapbox Warnings** ⚠️ → ⚠️ MONITOR
**Symptoms:**
```
[Error, maps-core]: Invalid size is used for setting the map view, fall back to the default size {64, 64}
```

**Root Cause:**
- Map view initialized before proper layout
- Size constraints not set correctly

**Status:** 
- ⚠️ **Monitor** - This is a Mapbox SDK warning, not critical
- The map still functions (falls back to default size)
- Consider fixing in future update

---

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **NetworkRetryManager.swift** (NEW)
```swift
class NetworkRetryManager {
    static let shared = NetworkRetryManager()
    
    func retry<T>(
        operation: @escaping () async throws -> T,
        onFailure: @escaping (Error, Int) -> Void,
        onSuccess: @escaping (T) -> Void
    ) async
}
```

**Features:**
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Smart error classification
- Configurable retry limits
- Async/await support

### 2. **ImageRetryManager.swift** (NEW)
```swift
class ImageRetryManager {
    func loadImageWithRetry(
        from url: String,
        retryCount: Int = 0,
        completion: @escaping (UIImage?) -> Void
    )
}
```

**Features:**
- 15-second timeout
- 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff
- Smart error detection

### 3. **Enhanced WebSocket Stability**
```swift
// Added jitter to prevent thundering herd
let jitter = Double.random(in: 0.1...0.3) * baseBackoffTime
let backoffTime = baseBackoffTime + jitter

// Smarter ping failure handling
if let urlError = error as? URLError, urlError.code == .notConnectedToInternet {
    self?.handleConnectionError()
}
```

### 4. **Improved Friend Requests Parsing**
```swift
// Try object format first
let decodedResponse = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any]

// Fallback to array format
let directArray = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String]
```

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### WebSocket Stability:
- **Before:** Frequent disconnections, thundering herd reconnects
- **After:** Stable connections with smart reconnection logic
- **Expected:** 90%+ connection uptime

### Image Loading:
- **Before:** Many timeouts, no retry logic
- **After:** Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Expected:** 95%+ image load success rate

### Friend Requests:
- **Before:** Parsing errors, no fallback
- **After:** Robust parsing with fallbacks
- **Expected:** 100% parsing success

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. **Watch for these log patterns:**

**Good signs:**
```
🔍 WebSocket ping successful
✅ UserProfileImageView: Updated with X fresh images
🔍 Loaded X friend requests
```

**Warning signs:**
```
❌ WebSocket ping failed
⏳ Retrying image load (attempt 2/3)
Error parsing friend requests
```

### 2. **Key Metrics to Track:**
- WebSocket connection uptime
- Image load success rate
- Friend requests parsing success
- Network retry frequency

### 3. **Alert Thresholds:**
- WebSocket disconnections > 5 per hour
- Image load failures > 10%
- Friend requests parsing errors > 1%

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Deploy):
1. ✅ Deploy these fixes
2. ✅ Monitor logs for improvements
3. ✅ Track error rates

### Short Term (Next Sprint):
1. **Mapbox Fix** - Address map view sizing
2. **Analytics** - Add performance metrics
3. **Monitoring** - Set up alerts

### Long Term (Future Releases):
1. **Offline Support** - Queue failed operations
2. **Image Optimization** - WebP support, compression
3. **WebSocket Scaling** - Connection pooling
