üîç DEBUGGING FILES CREATED FOR TOUCH BLOCKING ISSUE

Three comprehensive debug guides have been created to help solve the 
random button unresponsiveness issue in EventCreationView:

1. EVENT_CREATION_DEBUG_GUIDE.md
   - Detailed explanation of all debug output
   - Step-by-step scenarios and what to look for
   - How to interpret each debug symbol
   - Common causes and solutions

2. TOUCH_BLOCKING_DEBUG_SUMMARY.md
   - Overview of the problem
   - List of all debugging added
   - How to debug step-by-step
   - Implementation details

3. QUICK_DEBUG_REFERENCE.md
   - Quick 30-second reference card
   - Quick checks for button issues
   - State values to watch
   - Most likely causes

FILES MODIFIED:
- EventCreationView.swift
  Added ~100 lines of debug code including:
  - View render tracking
  - Button tap logging
  - Loading state tracking
  - Overlay visibility logging
  - Defensive .allowsHitTesting() on critical buttons

WHAT THE DEBUGGING TRACKS:
‚úì View re-render count and timing
‚úì All button taps with timestamps
‚úì State changes (isLoading, overlays, etc.)
‚úì Loading overlay lifecycle
‚úì Which overlays are visible
‚úì Touch blocking detection

HOW TO USE:
1. Build and run the app
2. Try to reproduce the touch issue
3. Keep Xcode console visible (View ‚Üí Debug Area ‚Üí Show Console)
4. When buttons stop working, screenshot the console
5. Reference the debug guides to interpret the output
6. Look for patterns like:
   - üü† CRITICAL but no üü¢ CRITICAL (loading stuck)
   - Missing üñ±Ô∏è [DEBUG] (touch blocked)
   - High render count (state thrashing)
   - State values showing overlays are true

This comprehensive debugging should finally reveal exactly what's 
causing the intermittent touch blocking!

üéØ The logs will tell us everything!
